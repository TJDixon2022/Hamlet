WPF or Avalonia for the UI shell?

| | WPF | Avalonia |
|---|---|---|
| Platform | Windows only | Windows/Linux/macOS |
| Maturity / tooling | Deepest, designer support | Good and improving |
| Tim's familiarity | High (old-school C#) | New |
| Open-source audience | Windows hams only | All — and Linux is common in ham shacks |
| WriteableBitmap waterfall | Native | Equivalent (WriteableBitmap exists; API differs slightly) |

Industry-standard answer for a public open-source ham tool: Avalonia, for the
Linux audience. Fastest-start answer: WPF. Per §0, "faster to start" is not a
reason, but "Tim ships phase 1" has weight too. Tim rules.

Obtain the IC-7300 CI-V reference (the "Full Manual" / CI-V command tables
from Icom) so the command facts in CLAUDE.md §4 can be verified and the cited
pages vendored into data/vendor/.

Everything Claude currently holds about 0x17 (CW send), 0x27 (scope data),
frame format and BCD encoding is general knowledge, marked unverified. Code
must not depend on an unverified command byte. Tim downloads the PDF from
Icom and uploads it to the session; Claude extracts and vendors the cited
sections only.

**CLOSED 2026-08-14 (HM-DEC-049).** Tim supplied the Full Manual and section 19
CONTROL COMMAND was read directly. §4 now carries the verified facts with page
citations, two corrections and one precondition nobody had written down.

**The vendoring half was NOT done, and that is the ruling rather than an
omission.** Icom's terms permit individual use and prohibit redistribution, so
the repository cites pages and carries none of the PDF. §4's "vendor the cited
pages" rule stands for sources that allow it; this one does not, and §2.1 wins.

Station configuration facts from Tim's PC: the COM port the IC-7300
enumerates as, the exact audio device names ("USB Audio CODEC" variants),
the radio's CI-V baud and CI-V address menu settings, and CW sidetone pitch
setting.

These are config values, not constants. Needed before the first
connect-and-read-frequency test. Device Manager and the radio's SET menu
answer all of them in five minutes at the desk.

FT8 decode integration approach: P/Invoke wrap of ft8_lib, or shell out to a
WSJT-X jt9 subprocess?

ft8_lib is small, clean C, designed for embedding; jt9 is the reference
decoder with better weak-signal performance but a process boundary and
version coupling. Both are GPL (HM-DEC-004 already accounts for that).
Decide during phase 3 planning; nothing before then depends on it.

Move the band plan out of code into a source-marked data file in /data, with
citations (ARRL band plan, FCC Part 97) and per-license-class privileges.

The current BandPlan.cs carries US allocations marked [extrapolated] from
general knowledge. Fine for phase 1 tuning; not fine as the basis for FG-006
band-plan coaching or transmit-privilege warnings, which need cited,
class-aware data. Generate-don't-transcribe applies (§0).

**NARROWED 2026-08-13 (HM-DEC-029).** The privileges half is done:
`data/privileges/us-part97-privileges.json` carries 47 CFR 97.301, 97.305 and
97.307 transcribed from eCFR, cited per row, with its gaps declared as explicit
unknowns. Transmit-privilege warnings now rest on cited data.

What remains is `BandPlan.cs` itself, which still holds three kinds of number
in code:

- **Band edges** (`LowHz`, `HighHz`). Now redundant — the same edges are in the
  privileges file under the Extra class, which by definition reaches every band
  edge. These should be derived from it rather than kept in parallel.
- **CW segment boundaries** (`CwLowHz`, `CwHighHz`). Still [extrapolated].
  These are convention, not regulation, and they do NOT align with the
  privilege boundaries — both encodings are needed and neither derives from the
  other (HM-DEC-029).
- **Jump spots** (`JumpHz`). Editorial: QRP watering holes and activity
  conventions. A citation would be an ARRL band plan or a club convention, not
  a regulation.

So this stays open at severity `none`, now meaning: derive the band edges from
the cited data, and give the conventions a source mark of their own kind.
